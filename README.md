# RTX video tool
A janky simple thingy i made to toggle RTX Video on or off quickly

You can use ctrl+alt+r or double click the tray icon to toggle RTX Video

Beaware that this uses a hidden Nvidia control panel window in the background to change the settings so funky issues may occur
just in case, you can use the tray menu to unhide the control panel

the code is super messed up because i tried vibe coding it at the start but literally nothing worked so i had to change almost everything and now its a certified mess
