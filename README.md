You can use Ctrl+Alt+R or double click the tray icon to toggle RTX Video

Beaware that this uses a hidden Nvidia control panel window in the background to change the settings so funky issues may occur\
Just in case, you can right click the tray icon to unhide the control panel\
Also this uses autohotkey under the hood so some anticheats may become unhappy, they shouldnt

The code is super messed up because i tried vibe coding it at the start but literally nothing worked so i had to change almost everything and now its a certified mess
